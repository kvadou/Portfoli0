Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Built a mobile responsive portfolio website with Bootsrap CSS Framework. 3 pages can be found on the navbar to toggle between index, portfolio and contact page.  Font Awesome kit was utilized to display LinkedIn and Github images on the About Me page.

Semantic HTML was included along with alt image descriptions for accessability. HTML was validated using validator.w3.org.
